# UNCONGESTED-OUTLET-DETECTION-METHOD-BASED-ON-ACCESS-POINT-MAPPING
With the advancement of technology and easy at-home availability of services to the customers, people have now become habituated to instant results.
People spend a large amount of time in purchasing goods and services which can be reduced by visiting less congested outlets. 
This would automatically imply shorter queues and easier navigation in the outlets along with lesser demand experienced by the network. T
he crowd in different outlets of the same brand is never equally distributed and varies with time. 
There are a number of Wi-Fi routers inside and around every outlet. 
If their networks are not secured properly, they can be used for access point mapping. 
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that helps the user to select an uncrowded outlet that is close to them and has the least traffic. 
Building on existing papers that show how to calculate crowd density through Bluetooth, RF frequencies, and image processing of CCTV footage, this research aims to calculate the crowd density of any locality with the help of access point mapping or war driving. 
This strategy can be further expanded to search for a particular product at the best price through several outlets.
Besides ensuring less congested outlets, it can also help to reduce road traffic, as well as encourage equality of income for the outlets. 
In a pandemic like Covid-19 this strategy can also be effective by helping people stay away from overcrowded areas.
